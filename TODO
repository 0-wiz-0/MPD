*) Rewrite replaygain stuff:
	*) Replay gain struct with album and track gain's and peak's
	*) Pass these to replaygain function
	*) Don't have deocder plugins inquire weather or not to use replaygain,
		they should just parse tags and pass these to replaygain func
	*) If replaygain tag info present, average the replaygain gain's
		and peak's on the fly
	*) If NULL replaygain struct, then use the average replaygain gains
		and peak's to compute the the scale for files missing
		replaygain tags (make this a config file option)

*) Optimize read() on cleints

*) Add libshout && vorbis encoding support

*) add command that only takes file's or url's (no directory's) and returns the songid of the added song

*) allow add commands to specify position to be inserted

*) saved playlist commands for getting the contents of a playlist and appending to a playlist

*) have listallinfo return directories

*) allow find/search commands take arbitrary search pairs

*) abstract out input buffering from inputStream_http to inputStream

--------
1) crosslink "list" stuff, for example, artists are crosslinked to alubms and 
vice versa, this way you can do list album artists or list artist albums, this 
will make life easier when we add genre and other metadata

2) rewrite linked list impelmentation to be more flexible
	a) remove "key" stuff
	b) allow assigning a compare function for a list
