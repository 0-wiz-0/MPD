1) Construct a small metadata buffer
	a) MetadataChunk struct
		1) functions for converting between block and MpdTag
		2) char * buffer
		3) positions ints for name, title, artist, album
	b) MetadataChunk buffer in OutputBuffer
		1) deal with incrementing and finding a free buffer Chunk
			the decoder element
		2) corresponding metachunk # for each audio chunk
	c) player proccess
		1) if not metachunk be sure to clear the current metadata
			in playerControl
		2) if it is, if WRITE, then write do pc->metadataChunk

2) Parse icymetadata

3) Put a new metadata entry for icyName for Song's

4) put some sort of error reporting for streaming/inputStream!

5) Fix charset errors so they don't goto stderr/out

6) Add a timeout for streams (how long? 1 minutes?)


Post-1.0
--------
1) crosslink "list" stuff, for example, artists are crosslinked to alubms and 
vice versa, this way you can do list album artists or list artist albums, this 
will make life easier when we add genre and other metadata

2) rewrite linked list impelmentation to be more flexible
	a) remove "key" stuff
	b) allow assigning a compare function for a list
