----

*) cleanup linked list code!

*) implement listener socket protocol as documented here:
	http://www.musicpd.org/wiki/moin.cgi/MpdListenerProtocol

*) support for dynamically loading plugins
	*) cleanup input plugins "API"
	*) cleanup output plugins "API"

*) input plugins
	*) Handle mp1 and mp2 files (including files with mp3 suffixes) 
	*) read replaygain info from id3 tag

*) add error codes for status->error

*) Cleanup Config File Code

*) audio output
	*) write a esd native audioOutput
	*) write a nas native audioOutput
	*) need better resampling code
	*) allowing "pausing" of audio output devices
	*) while pausing, play silence for the devices that don't support 
	   "pausing"
	*) write a sun native audioOutput
	*) more accurate time reporting by determing how much of audio_device
                buffer has been played

*) state
	*) abstract out state code from playlist.c
	*) save states of audioOutput devices
	*) put MPD Version in statefile

*) rewrite saved playlist code
	*) abstract out saved playlists from playlist.c
	*) command for displaying playlist contents
	*) command for appending to playlist
	*) new commands
		*) clear <playlist> /* synonym for rm */
		*) add <playlist> <path>

post-1.0
----

*) rewrite audio pipe
	*) use pthreads/clone
		*) try to constrain the use of pthread mutex's and condition's
			to specific output plugins
	*) use pull model for audio_output
	*) threads
		0) managing thread
			*) recieves commands
			*) manages state
			*) handles time/metadata sending
		1) decoding thread
		2) effects thread
			*) crossfading
			*) *command* resampling/conversions
		3) audio_output thread
			*) thread for each audio_output device

*) dynamic metadata
	*) implment by recording the ftell positions of entries
	*) buffer changes and flush them once every 60 seconds
	*) buffer changes while doing an update
	*) be sure to check that the metadata "header" is what we expect
	   before writing at the position
	*) add support for:
		*) last time played
		*) times played
		*) times skipped
		*) ranking
