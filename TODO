*) Implement HTTP proxy

*) Optimize read() on cleints

*) Optimize db update

*) deal with recursive symbolic link
	1) track st_ino and st_dev for each directory
	2) when adding a directory, be sure its st_ino and st_dev aren't
		the same as a parent
	3) need to sore parent directory in directory struct
	4) ~12 bytes per directory entry

Post-1.0
--------
1) crosslink "list" stuff, for example, artists are crosslinked to alubms and 
vice versa, this way you can do list album artists or list artist albums, this 
will make life easier when we add genre and other metadata

2) rewrite linked list impelmentation to be more flexible
	a) remove "key" stuff
	b) allow assigning a compare function for a list
