1) 24-bit pcm-tools (this may just wait since almost no one uses it)
2?) put software mixer settings in state file
3) Dealing with symlinks and new db:
	a) id3 talbe: artist->album->song
		song: 	key->title,
			data->tag (add SongList of symlinks)
	b) check for symlinks by comparing realpaths
	c) when writing songs to db, put duplicate links
	d) when reading db, check duplicate links, if duplicate link,
	   then just copy the tag.
