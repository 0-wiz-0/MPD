1) put some sort of error reporting for streaming/inputStream!

2) Fix charset errors so they don't goto stderr/out

3) Add a timeout for streams (how long? 1 minutes?)

4) compute time of vorbis from actual number of samples played

5) remove previous hack for streams

6) add "plversion" and "currentsong" commands


Post-1.0
--------
1) crosslink "list" stuff, for example, artists are crosslinked to alubms and 
vice versa, this way you can do list album artists or list artist albums, this 
will make life easier when we add genre and other metadata

2) rewrite linked list impelmentation to be more flexible
	a) remove "key" stuff
	b) allow assigning a compare function for a list
