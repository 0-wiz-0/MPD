1) remove wrap from ring buffer code, its not 100% safe
	a) player, just ensure that begin != end
	b) decoder: compute what the next chunk needs to be
		and wait till begin is no longer that

2) put some sort of error reporting for streaming/inputStream!

3) Fix charset errors so they don't goto stderr/out

4) Add a timeout for streams (how long? 1 minutes?)

5) compute time of vorbis from actual number of samples played

6) remove previous hack for streams

7) add "plversion" and "currentsong" commands

8) in libmpdclient, buffer all stuff going out for playlist command,
	should make it much faster


Post-1.0
--------
1) crosslink "list" stuff, for example, artists are crosslinked to alubms and 
vice versa, this way you can do list album artists or list artist albums, this 
will make life easier when we add genre and other metadata

2) rewrite linked list impelmentation to be more flexible
	a) remove "key" stuff
	b) allow assigning a compare function for a list
