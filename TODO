1) On exploring a directory:
	1) detect if any songs were added
	2) if no songs added remove explored directory
	3) use this info on exploring directory to adjust whether or not an
		update happened
	4) remove the deleteEmptryDirectories() function

2) resampling audio for compatibility, and better gapless/crossfading
	a) write bit conversion stuff (8->16 and 24->16)
	b) mono to stereo conversion
	c) default audio format is (44.1khz, 16-bit, stereo)
	d) option to set default sampling frequency
	e) abitility to disable resampling and audio format conversion

3) when writing combined interface for all decodes to use, be sure to add a 
common function and abstrct dealing with DecoderControl * and put
cycleLogFiles in there, so we cycleLogFiles while decoding, not just when 
decoding has stopped.

4) cleanup main()

5) handle '\n' in filenames

6) reaplygain


Post-1.0
--------
1) crosslink "list" stuff, for example, artists are crosslinked to alubms and 
vice versa, this way you can do list album artists or list artist albums, this 
will make life easier when we add genre and other metadata

2) rewrite linked list impelmentation to be more flexible
	a) remove "key" stuff
	b) allow assigning a compare function for a list
