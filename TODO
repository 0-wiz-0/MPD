1) resampling audio for compatibility, and better gapless/crossfading
	a) write bit conversion stuff (8->16 and 24->16)
	b) mono to stereo conversion
	c) default is 44.1khz, 16-bit stereo, if 44.1khz fails, try 48khz
	d) option to set default sampling frequency
	e) abitility to disable resampling and audio format conversion

2) non-blocking (for other clients) update
	j) when reading new directory db, we should block some signals when 
		manipulating the directorydb, so we don't receive a signal to 
		quit in the middle of an update
	k) when bg-update, have parent print out new old stuff to log on 
		reading db, not the child
	n) mpd command for rereading db
	o) rewrite update functions to indicate if something was updated, then
	 	when update process returns, indicate wheater db was updated
		and should be reread by parent process
	p) set error: in status when an error occurs during update

3) have children close all logging stuff, and redirect stdout and stderr to
/dev/null, and set error bits in the shared log for the parent process
to check when it receives a SIGUSR1, and print logs and then reset values of
error bits. (don't redirect children's stdout and stderr to /dev/null if mpd is
run with --no-daemon)

4) cleanup main()

5) crosslink "list" stuff, for example, artists are crosslinked to alubms and 
vice versa, this way you can do list album artists or list artist albums, this 
will make life easier when we add genre and other metadata
