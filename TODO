1) add song# to metadata when printing songs

2) add updated songs command, to output list of updated songs:
	updatesongs <since-playlist-version>

3) Parse icymetadata

4) Put a new metadata entry for icyName for Song's

5) Add a list_OK options for command_lists, to get a list_OK after each
	command

6) put some sort of error reporting for streaming/inputStream!

7) Fix charset errors so they don't goto stderr/out

8) Add a timeout for streams (how long? 1 minutes?)


Post-1.0
--------
1) crosslink "list" stuff, for example, artists are crosslinked to alubms and 
vice versa, this way you can do list album artists or list artist albums, this 
will make life easier when we add genre and other metadata

2) rewrite linked list impelmentation to be more flexible
	a) remove "key" stuff
	b) allow assigning a compare function for a list
