                       Music Player Daemon (MPD) - UPGRADING

Upgrading to 0.9.3
------------------

Wave support was added, so to have your wave files added, update the db (mpc
update).  

Also, song lengths are now stored in the db.  To get this stuff
added to the db, you will need to recreate the db from scratch.  To do this,
run mpd with the "--create-db" commandline option. 

Upgrading to 0.9.0
------------------

The "stop_on_error" config parameter was removed, so be sure to remove this
parameter from your config file.

Upgrading to 0.8.x
------------------

If you have FLACs, then to have them added to your list of available music,
just use "update".

Upgrading from 0.5.x to 0.6.x
-----------------------------
If you have not compiled MPD with "make ogg", then nothing is needed.

If you compiled with "make ogg", just use "update" (available via the phpMp
interface) to add your OGGs to MPD's list of available music.
