    <title>Guideline for recommended tags</title>
    <para>
      Since there is no standard for tags in media files, this
      document is trying to give you some help deciding what tags to
      use.  The selection of these tags tries to cover the most
      widely used tags.  This way the tags might still work in other
      players, if you sync the database with your original media
      files.
    </para>

    <tag>
      <name>Rating</name>
      <value>1-5</value>
      <para>
        Will store a rating value from 1 (worst) to 5 (best) for a given song.
      </para>
    </tag>

    <tag>
      <name>Album Rating</name>
      <value>1-5</value>
      <para>
        Will store a rating value from 1 (worst) to 5 (best) for a given album.
      </para>
    </tag>

    <tag>
      <name>Style</name>
      <value>Keyword</value>
      <para>
        This tag is used to keep the Genre tag clean, by now having 1000's of genres.
        Instead you define a Main Genre for each file and can make a more specific
        description. This should be one Keyword like "Post Punk" or "Progressive Death Metal"
        An Alternative name for this tag is "Subgenre", time will tell which one gets
        more support.
      </para>
    </tag>

    <tag>
      <name>Lyrics</name>
      <value>The lyrics of the song, including header with Artist - Title</value>
      <para>
        This one is self explaining. This gives the option to store lyrics of
        a song where they belong to: mapped to the song
      </para>
    </tag>

    <tag>
      <name>Similar Artists</name>
      <value>Comma seperated list of artists</value>
      <para>
        This tag enables a last.fm alike aproach which will still work when being offline
        Keep in mind, that this tag is absolutely non-standard! I am not aware of any
        other player that uses a comparable tag.
